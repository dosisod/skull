# SFX (Skull Feature eXpansion)

SFX is what allows for features to be added into the skull programming language.

It is similar to other programming language proposal systems (such as PEP for python).

# What is a "feature"?

Features are:
* Unique, non-bug fix related enchancements.
* Syntax / function / library ideas or proposals.
* Other (guidelines, abstract concepts, etc).

Features that build upon an existing SFX should be added to that SFX.

# How to propose an SFX

Start by opening an issue titled: `"[SFX] related title here"`.

The SFX will be reviewed for uniqueness, clarifing questions will be asked as needed.

If your SFX is considered, it will be added to the [SFX Folder](/docs/sfx/).

If it is not considered, don't worry! Your SFX may be reconsidered later down the road!

Even if an SFX is officially added, it may not be added to the language right away.
