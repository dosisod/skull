.TH SKULL 1 "JULY 2020" "Linux" "User Manuals"
.SH NAME
skull \- Run a skull file, or open a REPL
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B skull\fR [ \fIfile\fR ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Running \fBskull\fR without any parameters will open a \fBREPL\fR (read eval print loop). Each line is interpreted by \fBskull\fR, and the result (if any) is echoed to the screen. Passing a \fIfile\fR to \fBskull\fR is the same as manually typing in each line of the given \fIfile\fR into \fBskull\fR directly. skull files passed into \fBskull\fR must end with the ".sk" extenstion. All other file extensions will be ignored.
